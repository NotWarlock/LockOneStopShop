  <h2>Single Target:
  </h2>
    <h3>Opener:
    </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Precast Potion</li>
        <li>Precast Haunt if talented or Shadow Bolt if not</li>
        <li>Agony</li>
        <li>Corruption</li>
        <li>Siphon Life if talented</li>
        <li>Dark Soul if talented</li>
        <li>Racials and On-use Trinkets</li>
        <li>UA until you have 5 on the target, or run out of Shards. If Vile Taint is talented, make sure to leave 1 Shard available for Vile Taint</li>
        <li>Vile Taint or Phantom Singularity if talented</li>
        <li>If you gained any Shards during the previous GCD and have less than 5 UAs on the target, UA until you have 5 on the target or run out of shards.</li>
        <li>Darkglare</li>
        <li>Deathbolt if talented</li>
        <li>Proceed to normal priority</li>
      </ol>
      
    <h3>Normal Priority:
    </h3>
      <p>Unlike Legion, Battle for Azeroth Affliction generally follows a pretty basic priority list after your opener.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Racials and On-use Trinkets on cooldown</li>
        <li>Haunt on cooldown if talented</li>
        <li>Maintain Shadow Embrace if talented</li>
        <li>Maintain Agony</li>
        <li>Maintain Siphon Life if talented</li>
        <li>Maintain Corruption</li>
        <li>Phantom Singularity on cooldown if talented</li>
        <li>Vile Taint on cooldown if talented</li>
        <li>Dark Soul on cooldown if talented</li>
        <li>UA if you are at 5 Shards</li>
        <li>UA if UA is not on the target or will expire before the cast finishes. Skip this line if you are pooling for Darkglare, more on this later.</li>
        <li>UA once before Deathbolts. Skip this line if you are pooling for Darkglare, more on this later.</li>
        <li>Deathbolt on cooldown</li>
        <li>Shadow Bolt or Drain Soul</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>The rotation changes slightly leading up to your Darkglare cooldown. You should always try to have 5 Shards when Darkglare comes off cooldown to maximize the value of your primary cooldown. This generally means you want to stop spending Shards about 45 seconds before Darkglare comes off cooldown. You should still prioritize not capping Shards, so if you hit 5 use a UA.
      </p>
      <p>Shortly before your Darkglare comes off cooldown, you want to change your priorities. The time you want to start doing this at depends on talents and haste level. Generally just try to not let Darkglare sit off cooldown for more than a second or two.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Dark Soul if talented and off cooldown</li>
        <li>UA until you have 5 on the target, or run out of Shards. If Vile Taint is talented, make sure to leave 1 Shard available for Vile Taint</li>
        <li>Vile Taint or Phantom Singularity if talented</li>
        <li>If you gained any Shards during the previous GCD and have less than 5 UAs on the target, UA until you have 5 on the target or run out of shards.</li>
        <li>Darkglare</li>
        <li>Deathbolt if talented</li>
      </ol>
      
        <h4>Deathbolt Usage:
        </h4>
          <p>Deathbolt is an interesting topic. Because it snapshots the damage of all your DoTs on cast, we assumed figuring out the optimal sequence of DoT applications before it would matter for overall dps. Turns out, it really doesn't. There may be some technically correct way to refresh DoTs before a DB, but as far as we can tell it's unlikely to be more than half a percent dps difference between any usage of DB, so long as you use it on cooldown. Because of this, there's actually a great deal of flexibility in how you use DB. If you need burst immediately for an add or a to capitalize on a temporary damage increase on a boss, you can dump several UAs before a DB for a large spike of damage without hurting your overall dps much.
          </p>
          
        <h4>Azerite:
        </h4>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=273521/inevitable-demise" target="_blank">Inevitable Demise</a> causes your Corruption ticks to give you a stacking damage increase to Drain Life. It's worth using Drain Life Single Target with this trait. The optimal usage is to wait until you have 90+ stacks and you won't need to use a cooldown or refresh a DoT in the next 5 seconds, and then channel a full Drain Life. If you have 30 or more stacks and the boss is dying soon, Drain Life as well.</li>
            <li><a href="http://www.wowhead.com/spell=275372/cascading-calamity" target="_blank">Cascading Calamity</a> gives you a haste buff if you apply a second UA before your first UA expires. The usage is pretty basic, instead of waiting for UA to fall off to refresh, refresh just before it falls off.</li>
          </ul>
          
        <h4>Tips:
        </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Make sure to dump your UAs when the boss is near death so you don't end the fight with wasted Shards</li>
            <li>UA when adds are about 6-7 seconds from dying so that you get a refund</li>
            <li>Affliction is a Single Target specialist right now. With that in mind, always make sure you have Shards going into a boss fight in mythic+</li>
          </ul>

  <h2>Multi-target:
  </h2>
    <p>The Multi-target rotation is very similar to the Single Target rotation. The primary changes are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Maintain Agony on up to 8 targets at a time</li>
      <li>Maintain Corruption on all targets. On 3 or more targets, use Seed of Corruption to save Gcooldowns.</li>
      <li>Maintain Siphon Life on up to 4 targets at a time. However, if you need to be dotting 4 targets, you should probably using Absolute Corruption or Writhe in Agony.</li>
      <li>Maintain UA on as many targets as you can for the 10% damage increase debuff.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Seed of Corruption vs UA:</h3>
      <p>At current tuning, Seed is extremely weak. It's not really worth using until around 7-8 targets. That is, however, conditional on the targets living long enough to get full DoTs out AND have UA tick it's full duration. The number is often times realistically closer to 5-6 targets. With Sow the Seeds, the number is considerably lower at around 3 targets.
      </p>
      
    <h3>Shadow Embrace:
    </h3>
      <p>It's worth maintaining on 2 targets if you're using Absolute Corruption. AC allows you a lot of free globals for Shadow Bolt. Without AC, the talent is just unmanageable for Multi-target.
