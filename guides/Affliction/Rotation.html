  </p>
  <p>The rotation for affliction has changed drastically in 7.2.5, simply because more talents are now viable.  They focus on our 3 abilities in tier 15: Haunt, Writhe in Agony, and Malefic Grasp
  </p>
  
  <h2><u>Malefic Grasp</u></h2>
    <p>Malefic Grasp focuses on dumping UAs and then draining until the UAs expire to maximize their damage. The rotation is very cyclical, so a list of abilities doesn't do it justice. First, we need to understand what a UA cycle is. 
    </p>
  <h3>UA Cycles</h3>
    <p>Because your maintenance DoTs (Agony, Corruption, Siphon Life) have a temporary duration, you have to interrupt your Drain Soul at some point to refresh them. You want to dump your UAs when you know you won't need to refresh your other DoTs during the UA duration. So, the general concept is:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Wait for your maintenance DoTs to be in pandemic range (<30%).</li>
      <li>Refresh your maintenance DoTs</li>
      <li>Unstable Affliction 1-3 times. If you have 1 shard, use it. If you have 2, use both. Try to not spend more than 3 shards per UA cycle.</li>
      <li>If you've applied UA 3 times and you still have 4 or more shards, keep applying UAs until you drop to 3 shards.</li>
      <li>Reap Souls</li>
      <li>Drain Soul until UAs have expired</li>
    </ol>
  <h3>General Rules</h3>
    <p> Now that you have a basic idea of what a UA cycle looks like, there are some basic ground rules for how to prioritize actions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Life Tap should be used in downtime between UA cycles, or preferably during movement.</li>
      <li>Reap Soul should be used anytime you're dumping UAs. Delay use if there's an upcoming mechanic you need extra damage for.</li>
      <li>Maintenance DoTs are always more important than a UA cycle. Interrupt your Drain Soul if any of your up to 3 DoTs is about to fall off. This is important to keep in mind because sometimes you end up having to dump 4-5 UAs at a time with shard RNG.</li>
      <li>Preventing Shard capping is always more important than a UA cycle. NEVER HIT 5 SHARDS. If you hit 4 shards you should interrupt your current cycle and dump the UA.</li>  
      <li>If you're playing MG you probably don't care about your cleave dps. But, in the case that you do, it's worth it to interrupt a UA cycle to maintain your DoTs on up to 2 targets. 
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Contagion:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Maximizing the value of Malefic Grasp is higher priority than trying to optimize your UA uptime for Contagion. Basically, 25%>15%.</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>MG is more mobile than it was in 7.2, but it's still very immobile compared to many specs. Planning around fight timers that require you to move is crucial to mastering MG. Sometimes you may want to just dump ALL of your UAs and get less value from MG, so you don't cap while running about.</li>
      <li>Similar to the previous comment, it can be worthwhile to dump all of your shards during temporary damage buffs like wrath of consumpion and soul harvest, or if you simply need to burst an add.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h2><u>Writhe in Agony</u></h2>
    <p>The writhe rotation mainly focuses on maintaining DoTs, and trying to maximize the uptime on Contagion. If you're also taking AC on a fight, prepare for a snoozefest.
    </p>

  <h3>General Rotation</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Reap Souls should be used anytime at least 1 UA is on the target, or if you have a temporary damage buff like soul harvest.</li>
      <li>Maintain Agony on all targets.</li>
      <li>Never cap shards. If you're at 4 shards you should be using a UA or a Seed immediately.</li>
      <li>Maintain Siphon Life on all targets.</li>
      <li>Maintain Corruption on all targets. Sometimes it's worth it to use Seed to apply corruptions just to save the GCDs (think of harjatan murlocs).</li>
      <li>Life Tap if near low mana (<10%) or while moving.</li>
      <li>Drain Soul.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You may have noticed something missing. The use of Unstable Affliction outside of preventing shard capping. It's a bit too complicated to explain in a simple numerical list. It also depends on your talents. Below are some general guidelines on it's use.</p>
    <p><strong>Contagion:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>UA should be used to maintain your Contagion debuff at as high an uptime as possible. Try to only UA if you don't have a UA on the target, and maintain it on as many targets as possible, or if you risk capping shards.</li>
      <li>That being said, you should also look to dump any shards you have during large temporary damage buffs such as boss mechanics or soul harvest.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><strong>Aboslute Corruption/ELT:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You should try to pool your shards for temporary damage buffs. Trinkets procs, concordance of the legionfall, soul harvest, and boss mechanics are all good examples.</li>
      <li>If you go long periods without any of the above, or don't have access to any of the above, you should just dump any UAs you have during Reap Souls.</li>
    </ul>
  
  <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Because most of your damage is from DoTs, writhe is incredibly mobile and forgiving if you misposition yourself.</li>
      <li>Drain Soul Sniping (casting drain soul on a target that is about to die to gain a shard) is exceptionally strong with a Writhe due to the free GCDs that you have from not having to maintain Malefic Grasp cycles on a target.</li>
    </ul>
  <h2><u>Haunt</u></h2>
    <p>Haunt's rotation is almost identical to Writhe, with one notable exception. You should dump UAs during the haunt debuff if the UA will get at least 2 ticks off (50% of its duration) before haunt expires. This will vary based on your haste, so just play it by ear.
    </p>
  <h3>Notes</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The most important thing to mastering haunt is figuring out how to work around add timers on fights. If you know an add will be coming within the next ~20 seconds that you can kill in the duration of a haunt, delay your haunt so you can get a reset.</li>
      <li>Haunt amplifies Soul Flame, so if you're doing a fight like Scorpyron, you can use it to push more Soul Flame damage into the boss.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2><u>Cooldown Usage</u></h2>
    <p>Typical cooldowns include things like: on-use trinkets and rings, racials, and any of your talents.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You should use your cooldowns as close to the time they come up as possible. However, you may need to delay them for fight mechanics. You should delay your CDs if you know <b>important</b> adds, a temporary damage increase, or high movement are coming soon.</li>
      <li>For Single Target, you always want to have at least 2 UAs on the target before you use your cooldowns; there isn't much point in using cooldowns to just buff your Drain Soul.</li>
      <li>You can preemptively cast UAs right before CDs come up so you have them already rolling when you use the CDs.</li>
      <li>In the case of trinkets with a 1.5 to 2 minute cooldown, it doesn't matter if you use them as soon as they're up, or save them to use in together with Soul Harvest. You can macro these into your Soul Harvest if you have trouble tracking multiple CDs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><strong>Soul Harvest</strong></h3>
    <p>Soul Harvest is an exception to many of the rules listed above. It has a nifty secondary effect where every Agony you have active increases the duration by 4 seconds. You should try to get Agony out on as many targets as possible before using Soul Harvest to maximize its duration. This includes delaying its use for upcoming adds.</p>
  
  <h2><u>Seed of Corruption</u></h2>
    <p>Seed of Corruption use is pretty much the same for every talent. If you have Sow the Seeds talented, use Seed over UA on 3 or more targets. If you don't have Sow the Seeds talented, use Seed over UA on 5 or more targets. Seed isn't very useful without Sow the Seeds.
