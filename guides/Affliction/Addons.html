        <a href="http://www.tukui.org/dl.php" target="_blank">Elv UI</a> This is a great UI skin package, super clean, and very customizable. It also has a very nice module for customizing the boss unit frames for tracking dots easier.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/weakauras-2" target="_blank">Weak Auras 2</a> This is super duper helpful with tracking any sort of event / aura / thing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/lm9wozm92nqulph/DoomShards.zip?dl=0" target="_blank">Doom Shards</a> Handy UI for tracking shards and when you can expect a flood of shards. Has some "Rough predictions" of when you will likely get a shard from Agony. This version of Doomshards has been modified to work in tandem with the Soul Shard bit change that comes into effect in 7.2.5.

        <a href="https://wago.io/IpseShards" target="_blank">Ipse Shards</a>
        As an alternative to DoomShards there is a new Weak Aura by an amazing coder named Ipse who is replicating the functionality of DoomShards into a Weak Aura aptly called Ipse Shards which can be found by clicking on the link above. He sometimes has testing builds available as well <a href="https://wago.io/BkmU1Vqmb" target="_blank">here</a>

    <h2>Macros</h2>
    <p><strong>I will keep this section up as more good macros appear.</strong>
    </p>


    <p>If you would like to submit a macro for this section, please PM me on Discord.</p>
    How to make Demonic Circle work like PRE legion:<br>
    #showtooltip Demonic Circle<br>
    /cancelaura Demonic Circle<br>
    /cast Demonic Circle
    <p></p>

    <p>Cancel Burning Rush when stationary (IE: Draining) This will also work nicely with Unstable Affliction.<br>
    #showtooltip Drain Soul<br>
    /cancelaura Burning Rush<br>
    /cast Drain Soul</p>


    <p>Alt modifier for spell (in this case corruption). This allows you to cast on your focus target without actually targeting them. REALLY handy for keeping up dots on a second target during a fight.<br>
    #showtooltip Corruption<br>
    /use [mod:alt,@focus&#93;&#91;&#93;Corruption</p>

    <p>Mouse over Dots:
    #showtooltip Agony
    /use [@mouseover,harm][] Agony</p>
