<p>
    <strong>Tier 1</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=267115/flashover" target="_blank">Flashover</a> Conflagrate deals 25% increased damage and grants an additional charge of Backdraft. This talent also makes you able to hold on to 4 stacks of Backdraft.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=196412/eradication" target="_blank">Eradication</a> Chaos Bolt increases the damage you deal to the target by 10% for 7 sec. This debuff is applied once your Chaos Bolt reaches its target.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6353/soul-fire" target="_blank">Soul Fire</a> Burns the enemy's soul, dealing (100% of Spell power) Fire damage. Soul Fire's Cooldown is reduced by 2 sec for every Soul Shard you spend.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Currently the strongest option single target in this talent tier is Flashover. On 2 targets it is Eradication.
</p>

    <strong>Tier 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205148/reverse-entropy" target="_blank">Reverse Entropy</a> Your spells have a chance to grant you 15% Haste for 8 sec.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=266134/internal-combustion" target="_blank">Internal Combustion</a> Chaos Bolt consumes up to 5 sec of Immolate's damage over time effect on your target, instantly dealing that much damage.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=17877/shadowburn" target="_blank">Shadowburn</a> Blasts a target for (60% of Spell power) Shadowflame damage. If the target dies within 5 sec and yields experience or honor, Shadowburn's cooldown is reset.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> All of these options are interesting in their own way. Most of the time you will play Reverse Entropy, but Internal Combustion is very close to this. Shadowburn has some utility in its mobility.

<p>
    <strong>Tier 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=219272/demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a> Your Soul Leech absorption now passively recharges at a rate of 0.5% of maximum health every 1 sec, and may now absorb up to 15% of maximum health.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=111400/burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a> Increases your movement speed by 50%, but also damages you for 4% of your maximum health every 1 sec. Movement impairing effects may not reduce you below 100% of normal movement speed.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108416/dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark Pact</a> Sacrifices 20% of your current health to shield you for 250% of the sacrificed health for 20 sec. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Dark Pact can situationally be very useful but you'll end up choosing Burning Rush most of the time since it's the only real mobility we have as a warlock.

<p>
    <strong>Tier 4</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=270545/inferno" target="_blank">Inferno</a> Rain of Fire damage has a 20% chance to generate a Soul Shard Fragment.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=196408/fire-and-brimstone" target="_blank">Fire and Brimstone</a> Incinerate now also hits all enemies near your target for 40% damage and generates 1 Soul Shard Fragment for each additional enemy hit.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=152108/cataclysm" target="_blank">Cataclysm</a> Calls forth a cataclysm at the target location, dealing (180% of Spell power) Shadowflame damage to all enemies within 8 yards and afflicting them with Immolate.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Cataclysm is usually the best. Fire and Brimstone has some use on fights with low priority adds, as it gives you lots of shards.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Tier 5</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=264874/darkfury" target="_blank">Darkfury</a> Reduces the cooldown of Shadowfury by 15 sec.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=6789/mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a> Mortal Coil has some additional utility due the heal actually applying even if the target is immune to the Mortal Coil effect.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=268358/demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a> When you select this talent you will gain 2 spells. The first spell is a short cast that places a circle at your location for 15 minutes and the second spell teleports your character to that location.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> In raids you will always choose Demonic Circle. Often you can make some smart plays with this and possibly dodge a mechanic or reduce your downtime. In dungeons you can use Mortal Coil for the heal or if needed Darkfury for the reduced cooldown on Shadowfury.

<p>
    <strong>Tier 6</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=205184/roaring-blaze" target="_blank">Roaring Blaze</a> Conflagrate burns the target for an additional (48% of Spell power) Fire damage over 6 sec.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=266086/grimoire-of-supremacy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Supremacy</a> While you have an Infernal active, every Soul Shard you spend increases the damage of your Chaos Bolt by 8%.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=108503/grimoire-of-sacrifice" target="_blank">Grimoire of Sacrifice</a> Sacrifices your demon pet for power, gaining its command demon ability, and causing your spells to sometimes also deal (35% of Spell power) additional Shadow damage.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> GoSup immensely powerful if you need ST burst every 3 minutes, but it lacks on fights with adds and M+ in general. Roaring Blaze gives you strong consistent damage, and will usually be better on fights with adds. In M+, it comes down to where you use Infernal; RB if you Infernal trash, GoSup if you Infernal bosses.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Tier 7</strong>
</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=215941/soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a> Every Soul Shard you spend has a 15% chance to be refunded.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=196447/channel-demonfire" target="_blank">Channel Demonfire</a> Launches 15 bolts of felfire over 3 sec at random targets afflicted by your Immolate within 40 yds. Each bolt deals (16% of Spell power) Fire damage to the target and (7% of Spell power) Fire damage to nearby enemies.
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=113858/dark-soul-instability" target="_blank">Dark Soul: Instability</a> Infuses your soul with unstable power, increasing your critical strike chance by 30% for 20 sec.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Dark Soul and CDF are very close overall. Generally speaking, Dark Soul for boss damage, CDF for add/trash damage. You'll usually want CDF in M+ as it works very well with Cataclysm for trash dps. Soul Conduit is overall just kind of weak.
</p>


<h2>Suggested Talent Builds</h2>
 <p><strong>Single Target:</strong></p>

 <x-talent talent="1103023" spec="BFADestruction"></x-talent>

 <p>This talent setup is going to be your "go-to" setup for any single target raiding situation.</p>

 <p><strong>Two Target:</strong></p>

 <x-talent talent="2103023" spec="BFADestruction"></x-talent>

 <p>The difference between Fire and Brimstone and Cataclysm is incredibly small with Fire and Brimstone pulling slightly ahead. Fire and Brimstone is only worth it if the two targets are always stacked so unless this is the case then Cataclysm is the stronger option.</p>

 <p><strong>Dungeons:</strong></p>

 <x-talent talent="1123122" spec="BFADestruction"></x-talent>

 <p>This talent build offers you a lot of both consistent and burst damage on both single and multiple targets. I've said this before and i'll say it again, the combination of Cataclysm and Channel Demonfire on a pack in a dungeon is just a lot of burst damage! Roaring Blaze will probably be better for you if you use Infernal on trash instead of bosses. The reduced cooldown on Shadowfury is nice but can be swapped out depending on what you need.</p>
