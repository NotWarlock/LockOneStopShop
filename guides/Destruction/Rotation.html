<h2>General Rotation</h2>
<p>The Destruction Warlock playstyle is more of a priority list than a rotation. It will change a lot depending on the fight and the amount of Soul Shards you have.</p>

<em>The priority list is:</em>
<ul>
    <li>Apply Havoc if a secondary target is present</li>
    <li>Maintain Immolate</li>
    <li>Never cap on Soul Shards, make sure you cast Chaos Bolts at 4.5~ Soul Shards in order to avoid waisting a Soul Shard. When playing Eradication you should focus on keeping as high uptime on the debuff as possible. Obviously make your Chaos Bolt hit a target affected by Eradication.</li>
    <li>Rain of Fire on 3 enemies, 4 if havoc is up and you can CB instead. More on this in the Spec Mechanics segment</li>
    <li>Use Summon Doomguard/Infernal on CD</li>
    <li>Use Grimoire: Imp on CD</li>
    <li>Dont cap on Dimensional rift,if playing with Lessons of Space-time you should save stacks for times when you're about to cast multiple Chaos Bolts. If you're not playing with Lessons of Space-time you should try save these stacks for when you have to move.</li>
    <li>Dont cap on Conflagrate stacks, use this to generate shards when low</li>
    <li>Life Tap if very low on mana or you have to reapply Empower Life Tap. If playing Empower Life tap you should have 100% uptime on this regardless of not needing mana.</li>
    <li>Fill with Incinerate</li>
</ul>Some other things that should be mentioned are that when playing Roaring Blaze you should always make sure you refresh your Immolate after it's had it's final tick, if not then you end up losing damage. Also make sure you have Conflagrate stacks ready for your next Immolate before buffing it at 24 seconds of duration. When playing Backdraft all you should really look after is that you dont mindlessly lose stacks while not capping stacks. Obviously it's going to be worth over-capping with a single stack if it means you'll be able to refresh a 3-stack buff you would have lost otherwise.

    <h2>Opener:</h2>
    <p>The Destruction Warlock opener really differs from fight to fight and also depending on what talents/legendaries you're using. F.ex. if you're using Lessons of Space-time you should obviously not dump all your charges of Dimensional Rift right after each other, but if you're not using them you might aswell. This means you should not always follow this 100%, but it should give you a general idea of how to open on a boss fight. </p>
