    <h2>General info for all dungeons</h2>
    </div>

    <p>The number one thing you can do for your group is make sure they all have Healthstones all the time. The Soulwell is on a relatively short CD and heals for a truckload and then some. Whenever you have an opportunity put down a new Soulwell for everyone in the group to refresh their supply.<br>
    Use Potion of Prolonged Power as much as possible assuming it won't break your bank. For nearly every instance you can have 100% uptime of the potion. There are a few dungeons where Invis Potions, Skystep Potions or Avalanche Potions are very useful and can shave time off the run which will be outlined in a bit more detail per dungeon. All potions share a cooldown with each other.<br>
    You should also keep in mind that summon stones <i>do</i> work in Mythic+ so if someone leaves the dungeon you can get them back to your group however it does take two summons: one to get them into the instance (at the front) and another to get them to the group. Generally this is not worth the time investment if you are trying to hit a specific timer but can be useful if you need to change talents if you're already going to miss the timer.<br>
    Imp Dispel is very useful in almost all M+.  Here are some macros you can use to make its use a bit easier:<br>
    <ul>
    <li><i>Regular Imp</i> - /cast [@mouseover, exists][] Singe Magic</li>
    <li><i>Fel Imp</i> - /cast [@mouseover, exists][] Sear Magic</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>How to handle Affixes</h2>
    </div>

    <h3>Bolstering</h3>
    <p>Banished mobs do not bolster so if you can take advantage of Banishing a high HP target to avoid them gaining even more HP from the bolstering effect it is very good!</p>

    <h3>Explosive</h3>
    <p>Try to save Conflagrate for the orb spawns if you are required to do most of the damage to them.</p>

    <h3>Grievous</h3>
    <p>Dark Pact is a strong option depending on the dungeon to assist with mitigating some of the damage.</p>

    <h3>Bursting</h3>
    <p>Dark Pact is a good option to have depending on how big the packs are in the dungeon or if you are pulling multiple packs together.</p>

    <h3>Quaking</h3>
    <p>The best way to avoid getting locked out of your spells is to utilize the Quaking time to cast Conflagrate, drop Rain of Fire or use Life Tap.</p>

    <h3>Sanguine</h3>
    <p>If your group has or may have troubles with mobs getting stuck in Sanguine a possible solution is to use Mortal Coil.  Make sure you do not stun enemies in the Sanguine puddles!</p>

    <h2>Dungeon Specific Tips</h2>
    </div>

    <h3>Arcway</h3>

    <p>Enslaving an Eredar Chaosbringer (on the demon side of the dungeon, going left in the dungeon from the start) can be very useful but be sure to turn off the auto-casting feature on Brand of the Legion for more control over the power of the buff. The following macros are very useful:
    <ul>
    /cast [@player] Brand of the Legion<br>
    /cast [@mouseover,exists,help][] Brand of the Legion<br>
    </ul>
    One casts on you the other your mouseover if available and your target if not.<br>
    Be sure to dismiss this enslaved mob before the last boss or it can bug the encounter.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Banish can be extremely useful on a number of the demon packs on the left side of the dungeon as well. Be sure to use it accordingly and as needed.<br>
    By paying close attention to the timers on Xakal you are able to pre-cast Dark Pact with 17-18s before Wicked Slam and you will have Dark Pact for the 1st and 2nd slams allowing you to have Unending Resolve available to you for the 3rd slam and then rinse-repeat the Dark Pact cycle for the 4th and 5th casts of Wicked Slam.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Here are some additional uses of your abilities that can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-<a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> or just be useful in general:
    <ul>
    <li>Infernal can purge Brand of the Legion from Chaos Bringers and Unstable Flux from Withered Fiend.</li>
    <li>Doomguard can interrupt on Ivanyr.</li>
    <li>Xakal: Can stun or fear the bats.</li>
    <li>Nal'tira: Can stun or fear the spiders.</li>
    <li>Infernal can purge and Doomguard can interrupt on Advisor depending on group needs.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Darkheart Thicket</h3>

    <p>You can enslave the Tainted Summoner (one of the mobs right before Xavius) for a mega huge Dark Pact shield if required.
    </p>
    <p>This is how you can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-<a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses:

    </ul>

    <h3>Neltharion's Lair</h3>
    You can extend the length of Soul Harvest on every boss in this dungeon via add spawns.<br>
    You can solo kill the adds on Naraxus easily with havoc which lets your group focus on the boss more.<br>
    Dooomguard's Cripple can also be very useful on the final boss if you are kiting the Molten Giant to kill the boss and <i>accidentally</i> put on Immolate which broke the Hunter's trap ;).
    </p>
    <p>Some specific ways to proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses during this instance are:

    <li>Rokmara: Stun or Fear the Skitters.</li>
    <li>Dargrul: Stun the Molten Giant.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Eye of Azshara</h3>
    <p>You are able to solo the Crushing Depths that you would normally have to group soak even on fairly high keys by dismissing your pet, using Dark Pact adding Unending Resolve if absolutely necessary.</p>
    <p>To proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> in this instance consider the following:

    </p>

    <h3>Cathedral of Eternal Night</h3>
    <p>There is nothing really of note for this instance aside from some tips on how to proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses:

    <li>Amalgam: Stun the Banshees with Shadowfury/Infernal or Fear/Stun the spirit that is moving around near the boss room.</li>
    <li>Illysanna: Stun or interrupt (with Doomguard) the adds which spawn.</li>
    <li>Kur'talos: Dispel the sleep - do not get slept unless you know you will survive the short time before being dispelled.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Vault of the Wardens</h3>
    <p>The biggest tip for this dungeon is during the second boss, Inquisitor, where you can either use Immolate (safest bet) or Life Tap to clear Soul Sap mechanic.<br>
    Additionally consider proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> in this manner:
    <ul>
    <li>Tirathon: Doomguard can interrupt the boss or the adds which spawn.  Stun the adds which spawn.</li>
    <li>Inquisitor: Interrupt, stun or fear the adds during various phases. If your group can handle pulling an extra dog during the encounter you can chain proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> by Banishing the dog during non-add phases as well.</li>
    <li>Ash'golm: Doomguard can interrupt the Elementals.</li>
    <li>Cordana: Stun the Vengeance spawn.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Seat of the Trimvirate</h3>
    <p>There is also a variety of ways you can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> during this instance:

    <li>L'ura: Stun the small adds that come out of the portal.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Court of Stars</h3>
    <p>The biggest takeaway is that on trash when fighting Risen Arcanists you can purge Fortification using your Infernal. Alternate ways to proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on boss encounters as follows:

    <li>Melandrus: Can run into tornadoes and dispel with Imp.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Halls of Valor</h3>
    <p>Again there is little major tips for this instance aside from the fact that you are able to purge Protective Light from Stormforged Sentinals during trash. Otherwise consider proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses in the following fashion:

    <li>Imp can dispel the stun from the Thundercallers</li>
    <li>Fenryr P2: Stun or Fear the wolves that spawn.</li>
    <li>God-King: Stun the elementals.</li>
    <li>Odyn: Stun or interrupt the add</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Lower Karazhan</h3>
    <p>Major focus for this instance is proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> appropriately and when possible during boss encounters:

    <li>Wikket: Stun the monkeys or interrupt during Elfyra and Galindre if using Doomguard.</li>
    <li>Westfall Story: Interrupt the murlocs if using Doomguard.</li>

    <li>Maiden: Interrupt casts if using Doomguard.</li>
    <li>Moroes: Interrupt adds as needed if using Doomguard.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Upper Karazhan</h3>
    <p>This is a dungeon that benefits a lot from using Grimoire of Supremacy compared to Service because Medihv needs reliable interrupts. Apart from that here are some tips for proccing <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on bosses:
    <ul>
    <li>Shade of Medivh: Interrupt Frost casts.</li>
    <li>Viz'aduum: Interrupt casts or Stun/Fear mobs on the third platform.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Maw of Souls</h3>
    <p>Last and certainly not least everyones favourite fast instance does not offer much in terms of tips however you can proc <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/132452-sephuzs-secret" target="_blank"><span style="color: #FF8C00">Sephuz's Secret</span></a> on trash through stuns from Shadowfury/Infernal and otherwise in these cases during boss encounters:
    <ul>
    <li>Harabaron: Interrupt the Servitor if using Doomguard or stun the fragments.</li>
    <li>Helya: Interrupt casts if using Doomguard.  Dispel Taint of the Sea with Imp.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
