  <strong>Tier 1</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196406-backdraft" target="_blank">Backdraft</a> causes your Conflagrate to grant you 2 stacks of a 10 second buff that reduces the cast time of your next Incinerate or Chaos Bolt by 30% this buff stacks up to 4 times.
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205184-roaring-blaze" target="_blank">Roaring Blaze</a> causes your Conflagrate cast on an enemy with Immolate to increase the remaining damage your Immolate will do to that target by 25%. The bonus damage is lost if you refresh your Immolate on the target before the Immolate runs off by itself.
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/17877-shadowburn" target="_blank">Shadowburn</a> replaces your Conflagrate. When you cast Shadowburn on a target you generate 1 shard and apply a 5 second debuff on that target. If the target dies while affected by this debuff you will gain 1 more shard. This debuff's duration is refreshed if you cast shadowburn on a target already affected. This means you wont be able to get more than 1 shard from a target dying.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Theoretically in the majority of situations you'll wanna go Roaring Blaze here since with the tier 19 4-set you'll be able to get more conflagrates into your Immolate duration, however Roaring Blaze requires such a change in playstyle that often times you wont be able to use it to it's full potential. Therefore Backdraft will be your default choice here.

<p>
  <strong>Tier 2</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/205148-reverse-entropy" target="_blank">Reverse Entropy</a> Makes your Chaos Bolt and Rain of Fire refund 35% mana while also increasing the damage of these spells by 10%
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196412-eradication" target="_blank">Eradication</a> makes your Chaos Bolt apply a 7 second debuff on the target(s) hit that increases the damage you deal to that target by 15%. This debuff is also applied to targets hit by your Chaos Bolts through Havoc.
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235157-empowered-life-tap" target="_blank">Empower Life Tap</a> causes your Life Tap to grant you a buff that increases all damage you deal by 10% for 20 seconds.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> There are only really 2 viable choices here, you should either go Eradication or Empower Life Tap. On 1 and 2 targets Eradication is your best choice, once you introduce a 3rd target Empower Life Tap starts to pull ahead. This is obviously because you're unable to maintain the debuff on that many targets.

<p>
  <strong>Tier 3</strong>
</p>
<p>
   <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/48018-demonic-circle" target="_blank">Demonic Circle</a> creates when cast a circle on your location for 15 minutes. When cast again you will be teleported to this location and then spell will go on cooldown. If you'll later want to change the location of your circle within the 15 minutes of it's duration, you will have to cancel the buff and then cast it again.
   <br>
   <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108396-mortal-coil" target="_blank">Mortal Coil</a> horrifies your target for 3 seconds and heals you for 20% of your max hp. Havoc also copies this spell. The spell only heals if the target is affected by the fear.
   <br>
   <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/30283-shadowfury" target="_blank">Shadowfury</a> is a 1.5 second cast 8 yard stun that stuns all enemies in it's target range for 4 seconds.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> For a raiding situation you'll 90% of the time end up going Demonic Circle. Mortal Coil requires something to be able to be feared in order to be useful and if you choose this for the cc Shadowfury is really the stronger option as it cc's for longer, it's cc can't be broken by damage and it's cooldown is lower.

<p>
  <strong>Tier 4</strong>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152108-cataclysm" target="_blank">Cataclysm</a> hits all enemies within 8 yards of it's target location and applies Immolate to those targets.
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196408-fire-and-brimstone" target="_blank">Fire and Brimstone</a> is a passive that makes your Incinerate hit all enemies near your target.
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196098-soul-harvest" target="_blank">Soul Harvest</a> is sort of like the old Dark Soul. It's a 20% damage increase for 12 seconds, it's duration is extended by 4 seconds for every enemy afflicted by Immolate when cast. The duration can be extended up to 36 seconds.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Soul Harvest is your best choice for 1 and 2 targets. Once a 3rd consistent target gets introduced Fire and Brimstone starts to pull ahead. 
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Tier 5</strong>
</p>
<p>
   <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/219272-demon-skin" target="_blank">Demon Skin</a> makes your Soul Leech charge passively at a rate of 1% maximum health per second and also makes your Soul Leech absorb up to 20% of your max health instead of 15%
   <br>
   <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/111400-burning-rush" target="_blank">Burning Rush</a> increases your movement speed by 50% while damaging you for 4% of your max hp per second. Note that while this effect is active movement impairing effects may not reduce your movement speed to below 100% of normal movement speed. This effect cannot kill you.
   <br>
   <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108416-dark-pact" target="_blank">Dark pact</a> sacrifices 20% of your demon's health and grants you a shield of 400% of the sacrificed health. If you dont have a demon your health will be sacrificed instead. This can be cast while stunned.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> This tier is very situational, all choices have great utility however you'll want to be careful when using Burning Rush. That being said you'll go Burning Rush most of the time as warlocks do not have any movement speed increases and in some situations you will be able to dodge deadly mechanics while using this.

<p>
  <strong>Tier 6</strong>
</p>
<p>
   <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152107-grimoire-of-supremacy" target="_blank">Grimoire of Supremacy</a> makes you able to summon either a Doomguard or an Infernal as your permanent pet.
   <br>
   <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108501-grimoire-of-service" target="_blank">Grimoire of Service</a> makes you able to summon a second demon for 25 seconds on a 1.5 min cooldown. The summoned demon deals 100% increased damage. Depending on what pet you summon that pet will use one of it's special abilities when summoned.
   <br>
   <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/108503-grimoire-of-sacrifice" target="_blank">Grimoire of Sacrifice</a> sacrifices your pet and grants you a 1 hour buff that makes your spells sometimes deal additional damage from the target hit and in an 8 yrd range from that target. This buff is removed if you summon a new pet.
</p>
<p>
   <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Supremacy is the highest simming 1 and 2 target option, closely followed by Service. Once 3 consistent targets are in play Sacrifice starts to pull ahead. In a progression raiding scenario you may want to use Service over Supremacy since it offers a lot more on-demand burst damage potential which can be useful.

<p>
  <strong>Tier 7</strong>
</p>
<p>
 <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196410-wreak-havoc" target="_blank">Wreak Havoc</a> reduces the cooldown of your Havoc by 20 seconds.
 <br>
 <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/196447-channel-demonfire" target="_blank">Channel Demonfire</a> launches 15 felfire bolts over a 3 second cast to a random enemy afflicted by Immolate in a 40 yrd range of you. The bolts do splash damage to enemies near the target.
 <br>
 <a href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/215941-soul-conduit" target="_blank">Soul Conduit</a> is a passive that gives every soul shard you spend a 15% chance to be refunded.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>Final Thoughts</strong> Singletarget you should go Channel Demonfire, this offers the largest damage potential. 2 and 3 target you should go Wreak Havoc. Once you're fighting 4 consistent targets it's arguably going to be worth it to go Soul Conduit, however there are not many scenarios where this is going to happen. Especially not in a raid.
